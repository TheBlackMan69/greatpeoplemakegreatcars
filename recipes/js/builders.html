  <div class="box-text" style="width: 40%;float: left;">
  <p class="p">The AC Cobra, sold as the Shelby Cobra in the United States, is a British-American sports
    car with a Ford V8 engine, produced intermittently in both the UK and the US since 1962.
    Like many British manufacturers, AC Cars had been using the Bristol straight-6 engine in its
    small-volume production, including its AC Ace two-seater roadster. This had a hand-built body with a
    steel tube frame, and aluminium body panels that were made using  English wheeling  machines.
    In September 1961, American automotive designer  Carroll Shelby  wrote to AC asking if they would
    build him a car modified to accept a V8 engine. Bristol engines for the AC Ace two-seater sports car
    had recently been discontinued. AC agreed, provided a suitable engine could be found. Shelby went
    to Chevrolet to see if they would provide him with engines, but not wanting to add competition to
    the  Corvette  they said no. However, Ford wanted a car that could compete with the Corvette and
    they happened to have a brand new engine which could be used in this endeavor: the Windsor 221-
    cubic-inch (3.6 L) engine – a new lightweight, thin-wall cast small-block V8. Ford provided Shelby with
    two engines.
    The most important modification was the fitting of a stronger rear differential to handle the
    increased engine power.

    Engine
    The first 75 Cobra Mk1 models (including the prototype) were fitted with the 260 cu in
    (4.3 L). 
    The remaining 51 Mk1 models were fitted with a larger version of the Windsor Ford engine,
    the 289-cubic-inch (4.7 L) V8.
    Mk 3 This car was designed for the 427 cu. in. (7.0 liter) “side oiler” Ford FE V8. 425 bhp @
    6000 rpm and 480 ft/lb torque, which was capable of propelling the car to a top speed of 164 mph
    (262 km/hr)
    Race speck produced 485 bhp to give the car a top speed of about 185 mph (298 km/hr)</p>

  <p class="p">The Ford GT40 is a high-performance endurance  racing car . The Mk I, Mk II, and Mk III variants
    were designed and built in England based upon the British  Lola Mk6 . Only the Mk IV model was
    designed and built in the United States
    The GT40 effort was launched by Ford Motor Company to win long-distance  sports car
    races  against Ferrari, which won every 24 Hours of Le Mans race from 1960 to 1965. The GT40
    broke Ferrari&#39;s streak in 1966 and went on to win the next three annual races. The Mk II&#39;s victory
    was the first win for an American manufacturer in a major European race 
    The Mk.II was very similar in appearance to the Mk.I but used the 7.0-liter FE (427 ci) engine
    from the Ford Galaxie, used in NASCAR at the time and modified for road course use. The car&#39;s
    chassis was similar to the British-built Mk.I chassis, but it and other parts of the car had to be
    redesigned and modified by Shelby to accommodate the larger and heavier 427 engine.
    <img src="../images/ford-gt40-2.jpg"alt="" style="float: left; margin-right: 1%;">
  <p class="p" style="margin-left: 1%;"> 
     A new Kar Kraft-built four-speed gearbox replaced the ZF five-speed used in the Mk.I. This car is
    sometimes called the Ford Mk.II.
    
    Engine
    The 427 V8 was produced as both a top-oiler and side-oiler. Introduced in 1963, its true
    displacement was 425.98 cubic inches, but Ford called it the 427 because 7 liters (427 cu in) was
    the maximum displacement allowed by several racing organizations at the time. The block was
    made of cast iron with an especially thickened deck to withstand higher compression
    The 427 remains a popular engine among Ford enthusiasts.Rpm 6,500 ,532 tork , 626hp.

  <p class="p">The Honda Civic is a line of  cars  manufactured by Honda. Originally a  subcompact , the
    Civic has gone through several generational changes. EPA guidelines for  vehicle size class   is
    considerering a  mid-size car , and as such the tenth generation Civic sedan is technically a small-
    end mid-size car. The Civic coupé is still considered a compact car.
    The first generation Civic was introduced in July 1972 as a two-door model, followed by a three-
    door hatchback that was equipped with an 1169 cc  transverse engine  and front-wheel drive like
    the British Mini,
    The first Civic to receive the &#39; Type R &#39; name plate was based on the 6th-generation of the
    fan-base &#39;EK&#39; Civic. The contributing base model was the JDM Civic 3-door hatchback the Civic
    SiR&#39;s transformation into a Type R was achieved by working on the base model and improving it
    to Honda&#39;s idea of a car capable of high performance on the circuit.
    The first Civic to receive the Type R badge was introduced in August 1997, as the EK9.

    and other weight reduction measures. It hand-ported B16B engine and front helical limited-slip
    differential and a  Close-ratio transmission . The interior featured red RECARO bucket seats, red

S2000 is named after its two liters displacement.
Officially two variants exist: the initial launch model was given the chassis code AP1; though
cosmetically similar, the facelifted version, known as the AP2 in North America and Japan,
incorporated significant changes to the drivetrain and suspension.

the United States when production commenced in  Marysville, Ohio . The Accord has achieved
considerable success, especially in the United States, where it was the best-selling Japanese car
for sixteen years (1982–97), with around ten million vehicles sold. [3]
Honda Type R models are special performance editions of their respective model
families. The design of Type R models was originally focused on race conditions, with an
emphasis on minimizing weight, and maximizing performance potential. Type R models were first
conceived for  racetracks . However, due to Honda&#39;s increased focus on their VTEC  engines , Type
R vehicles were eventually designed for a much wider market

differentiated by features such as a stiffer suspension and chassis, Helical  limited-slip-differential ,
twin-piston brakes, dual exhaust system, 17-inch alloy wheels, Xenon headlights,  Recaro  seats

  <p class="p">
    The Mercedes-Benz CLR was a set of  racing cars  developed for Mercedes-Benz through
a collaboration with in-house  tuning division  Mercedes-AMG and motorsports specialists HWA
GmbH. [3]  Designed to meet Le Mans Grand Touring Prototype (LMGTP) regulations, the CLRs
were intended to compete in  sports car events  during 1999, most notably at the 24 Hours of Le
Mans. Three CLRs were entered for Le Mans in 1999 after the team performed nearly 22,000 mi
(35,000 km) of testing. [3]  The cars suffered aerodynamic instabilities along the circuit&#39;s long high-
speed straight sections. The car of Australian Mark Webber became airborne and crashed in
qualifying, requiring it to be rebuilt. Webber and the repaired CLR returned to the track in a final
practice session on the morning of the race, but during its first lap around the circuit, the car once
again became airborne and landed on its roof. Mercedes withdrew the damaged CLR but chose
to continue in the race despite the accidents. The remaining cars were hastily altered and the
drivers were given instructions to avoid closely following other cars.

  <p class="p" style="margin-left: 1%;"> 
     This and earlier incidents led
Mercedes not only to withdraw its remaining car from the event immediately, but also to cancel
the entire CLR programme and move the company out of sports car racing. [5]  The accidents led to
changes in the regulations dictating the design of Le Mans racing cars [6]  as well as alterations to
the circuit itself to increase safety. [7]
