      Carroll Hall Shelby (January 11, 1923 – May 10, 2012) was an American automotive designer, racing driver, entrepreneur, and author. Shelby is best known for his involvement with the AC Cobra and Mustang (later known as Shelby Mustangs) for Ford Motor Company, which he modified during the late 1960s and early 2000s. He established Shelby American Inc. in 1962 to manufacture and market performance vehicles, as well as Carroll Shelby Licensing in 1988 which grew into Carroll Shelby International. His autobiography, The Carroll Shelby Story, was published in 1967.
      Shelby honed his driving skills with his Willys automobile while attending Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas, Texas, graduating in 1940. He was enrolled at The Georgia School of Technology in the Aeronautical Engineering program. However, when World War II broke out, Shelby enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps, serving as a flight instructor and test pilot in the AT-11 Kansan and Curtiss AT-9 Jeep. He graduated with the rank of staff sergeant pilot in September 1942 at Ellington Field.Then, he raced Charles Brown's Cadillac-Allards at Caddo Mills, Texas .

        <p class="sub-hero-heading">
          Röhrl grew up as the youngest of three children of a stonemason in Regensburg. His parents separated when he was ten years old. From then on he lived with his mother. After leaving school he completed a commercial education at Bishop's Ordinariate Regensburg he liked skiing in his spare time. In time he became a qualified ski instructor and a keen driver. Some unqualified reports have stated he was once the Bishop's own driver. Having also now been active in sports like skiing, Röhrl was invited to drive his first rally in 1968.

          Röhrl was a World Rally Championship favourite throughout the 1970s and 1980s, winning the Monte Carlo Rally four times with four different marques. His co-driver for many years was Christian Geistdörfer. His Fiat 131 Abarth carried him to the 1980 title, clinched with his victory in that year's San Remo rally, but it was arguably his equivalent success in 1982 that impressed most of all, with Röhrl fending off audacious four-wheel drive opposition, led by Audi's resurgent Michèle Mouton, to take the title, by virtue of consistency, in his increasingly outmoded rear-drive Opel Ascona 400 in 1982.However, shortly after winning the championship he was fired from the team by team manager Tony Fall because he disliked competing in the RAC rally (the rally he had little success in). In 1983, he joined Lancia to pilot the new, rear-wheel drive Lancia 037, before finally changing his machinery, in 1984, to the four-wheel drive Audi Quattro, an automobile actually produced in his home state of Bavaria.
          In 1987 Röhrl set up a new record in the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb for being the first driver to cover the 14.42 miles (19.99 km) long mountain track to the Pikes Peak in less than 11 minutes. In his 600 hp (440 kW) Audi Sport Quattro S1 E2 he did the famed American hillclimb in 10 minutes and 47.850 seconds[6] to reach Pikes Peak on the road which at that time was mainly covered with gravel.
